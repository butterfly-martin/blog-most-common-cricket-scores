# blog-most-common-cricket-scores
This is the repository for a blog post titled "What are the most common scores in Cricket?"  to be published in May/June 2021 on www.butterflydata.co.uk.

The analysis can be found in the jupyter notebook "Distribution of cricket scores".

For the notebook to work, you will have to download the data for yourself and put it in the folder "raw_csv". Make sure the csvs are not in sub-folders.
Once you open the notebook, you will have to also change the filepaths in the first cell to point to your github folder and where you have downloaded the data to.

The data was taken from [Cricsheet](https://cricsheet.org/ "Cricsheet"). Head to downloads and I used the "new csv" format (down the bottom). I used all international scores from all 3 formats and both men's and women's. 
As far as I understand, the analysis should work using any of the cricsheet data as long as it's in the "new csv" format.

Any questions, tips or advice, get in touch on martin@butterflydata.co.uk
